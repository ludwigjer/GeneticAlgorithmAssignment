Usage:
Download source code
Run Project.java
Adjust Utilities.Constants to change initial conditions.
Enjoy
There is way to run only the world demo or GA demo. To do so, uncomment demoPopulation() or demoGA() in the Project.main()

Requirements:
 Singleton Pattern
 Factory Pattern
 Strategy Pattern
 Genetic Algorithm
Features:
Strategy pattern - refer to the Comparator package
Abstract Factory - refer to the Factory package
Genetic Algorithm - refer to the GeneticAlgorithmPackage package
Single point and Uniform reproducers. Refer to the ReproducerSinglePoint and ReproducerUniform at the GeneticAlgorithmPackage.Components package respectively.
Rank and Tournament selectors. Refer to the SelectorRank and SelectorTournament at the GeneticAlgorithmPackage.Components package respectively.
Callback interface for the Genetic Algorithm. Used to provide the best Route to the Comparator. Refer to the GeneticAlgorithmPackage.Components.
Singleton pattern. Refer to the Population.World class.
Parameterised class and Generics. Refer to the Population.Pair class.
Threading. Refer to the GeneticAlgorithmPackage.GeneticAlgorithm
Changelog:
version 1.0
Refactored and cleaned up code
Javadocs added
version 0.6
Implementation of the Strategy pattern
Comparator to compare the performance
version 0.5
Implementation of the Abstract Factory
Added Callback for the Genetic Algorithm
version 0.4
Reorganized package structure
Implementation of Genetic Algorithm concept
Introduced Helpers package to hold Utilities and Constants
Utilities hold static methods as this is the only option to keep them unique
Constants should be treated as settings for the program
There are multiple commented lines of println() statements: uncomment if you want to see data flow.

GeneticAlgorithmPackage holds GA related classes:

GeneticAlgorithm.java - the class to be used in Factory pattern.
Two samples of usage. There are 4 possible combinations so far.
Population package holds population related classes.

version 0.3
The program generates unidentical cities and routes in the world as well as calculate the length of each route. The class Population.World is a singleton.

version 0.1
Initial commit.
